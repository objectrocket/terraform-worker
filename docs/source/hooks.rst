Hooks
=====

Hooks are executable "cut-in" points that are available to a user during the course of executing a **terraform-worker**
configuration.  The hooks mechanism allows a user to insert an execuatable script in a ``hooks`` directory in a
**terraform-worker** definition.  The name of the hook should correspond to the ``pre`` or ``post`` event that the
script should target.

Hooks are discovered in a `./hooks` directory in a :ref:`filesystem-definition`. For routing a hook script to the proper
interpreter, **terraform-worker** relies on the filesystem's underlying mechanism (`the shebang, for example, on \*nix
systems`). Hook scripts should be named for the event that they target, ignoring the extension. So, a python hook script
running on a \*nix system targeting the ``post_apply`` event might be named: ``post_apply.py`` and might include
``#!/usr/bin/env python3`` on the first line.

Events
------

The **terraform-worker** provides event-based entry points for executing operations outside of terraform.  The following
list shows each of the hook events that the **terraform-worker** supports.

 * ``pre_plan``
 * ``post_plan``
 * ``pre_apply``
 * ``post_apply``
 * ``pre_destroy``
 * ``post_destroy``

Environment Variables
---------------------

The execution environment of a hook script is populated with the :ref:`terraform_vars <terraform-vars>` and :ref:`remote_vars <remote-vars>` values from the definition.
The naming convention for terraform_vars environment variables is ``TF_VAR_variable_name``.  The naming convention for 
remote_vars environment variables is ``TF_REMOTE_variable_name``.

If using complex data types (objects, lists) in the terraform variables, consider passing :ref:`\-\-b64-encode-hook-values <base-64-option>` to have the
variable values base64 encoded.
